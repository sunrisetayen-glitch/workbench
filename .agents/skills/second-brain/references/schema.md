# Schema (fallback)

**Authoritative source: `<vault>/CLAUDE.md`.** This file is a fallback used only when the vault's CLAUDE.md is missing.

The schema below mirrors the user's vault as of 2026-06-17. Update this file only if you're seeding a new vault from scratch.

```

## wiki/ — page format

```markdown
# Topic Name

Brief summary (2–3 sentences).

## Key Concepts

## Details
Main content organized by subtopic.

## Connections

```

## wiki/INDEX.md — format

```markdown
# Wiki Index

### Suggested wiki pages that compose with other makerskills

Pages whose existence makes other skills sharper:

| Wiki page | Composes with | Why |
|---|---|---|
| **Decision Log** | `decide` | Narrative version of decisions made — the `decide` skill archives one-off decisions; the wiki page is the story of how decisions stacked over time on a topic |
| **Content Ideas** | `jab-hook` | Centralized hopper of hooks, frameworks, stories — drafted posts pull from here |
| **Customer Language** | positioning + sales | Verbatim phrases from prospects/customers — used for copy, headlines, objections |
| **Offer Notes** | positioning | What's been tried, what landed, what didn't |
| **Recurring Questions** | sales, client onboarding | Questions asked >3 times across calls; pre-answered for SOP / FAQ / scripts |
| **Workflow Docs** | `pm` | Documented operational patterns — what gets done, by whom, on what cadence |
| **People** | agency, fundraising, partnerships | Contacts with context — a CRM-lite. Inspired by Gbrain's people entity. |
| **Companies** | clients, prospects | Org profiles with last touchpoint, opportunity, status |
| **Sales Objections** | sales scripts | Library of objections + best responses |
| **Sales Scripts** | sales | Templates assembled from Customer Language + Objections |

### Outputs categories

The `outputs/` folder hosts generated artifacts. Common kinds:
- Posts (social drafts, blog drafts)
- Reports
- Proposals (especially for agency work)
- SOPs (your own + client deliverables)
- Audits (typical agency deliverable)
- Research briefs (composes with `deep-research`)
- Sales scripts
- Client summaries
- Slide deck content (handed off to `slide-deck`)

## Rules

- **One page per concept** — not per source
- **Use `[[wikilinks]]`** for all internal references
- **Keep pages focused** — split if >500 words
- **INDEX.md is the root** — keep current
- **Connections section is mandatory** — every page links to ≥1 other page
- **No orphan pages**
- **Summaries are concise**
- **Preserve nuance** — don't flatten contradictions

## Publishing alternatives — how to render `outputs/`

When `outputs/<file>.md` should leave the vault as a polished artifact (research brief to a client, summary to share, slide-deck source, archive PDF), use one of these:

### Default: pandoc + shared stylesheet

```bash
# PDF (requires basictex: brew install --cask basictex, then once:
# sudo tlmgr update --self && sudo tlmgr install collection-fontsrecommended)
pandoc "outputs/<file>.md" \
  --css ~/.local/share/makerskills/render.css \
  --metadata title="<title>" \
  --pdf-engine=xelatex \
  -o "outputs/<file>.pdf"

# HTML (standalone, CSS inlined — drop into a static host or email as attachment)
pandoc "outputs/<file>.md" \
  --standalone \
  --embed-resources \
  --css ~/.local/share/makerskills/render.css \
  --metadata title="<title>" \
  -o "outputs/<file>.html"
```

Shared stylesheet at `~/.local/share/makerskills/render.css` — also used by `read-book`. Edit freely; system-font + max-width 720 + print-optimized.

### Heavier option: Quarto (`.qmd`)

[Quarto](https://quarto.org) is Posit's publishing system — markdown-superset with executable code blocks (Python/R/Julia), native citations + bibliography, cross-references, equations, and multi-format output (HTML, PDF, slides, ePub, books, websites).

**Worth adopting if you want any of:**
- A renderable **public-facing personal handbook / book / website** from the wiki (Quarto projects build full sites with navigation, search, themes)
- **Native citations** in research briefs (BibTeX/CSL → consistent inline + bibliography)
- **Executable analysis** inline in notes (bloodwork charts, financial models, ML experiments)
- **Cross-references** to figures / tables / sections by name (richer than positional markdown links)

**Costs:**
- Obsidian doesn't render `.qmd` natively — daily-driver editing UX degrades
- `[[wikilinks]]` are Obsidian-only; Quarto wants standard markdown links
- YAML frontmatter conventions differ from Obsidian's
- New tool (`brew install quarto`, ~500MB) + optional Python/R engines
- Learning curve (callouts, cross-ref keys, project config, `_quarto.yml`)
- Most second-brain operations (capture, compile, query) gain nothing from Quarto

**Status: skipped by default.** Pandoc + shared CSS handles 80% of publishing needs with 5% of the complexity. Revisit Quarto if/when:
1. You decide to publish the wiki as a personal handbook site, OR
2. You start writing a book using the corpus, OR
3. You add executable analysis to your notes

For everyday capture / compile / query / outputs, plain markdown + pandoc is plenty.
